  <h1>Twin Cities: Manchester and Wuhan</h1>
  <h2>Manchester, England</h2>
  <p>Manchester is a major city in the northwest of England with a rich industrial heritage. The Castlefield conservation area’s 
    18th-century canal system recalls the city’s days as a textile powerhouse, and visitors can trace this history at the intera
    ctive Museum of Science & Industry. The revitalised Salford Quays dockyards now house the Daniel Libeskind-designed Imperial
     War Museum North and the Lowry cultural centre.</p>

  <h2>Wuhan, China</h2>
  <p>Wuhan, the sprawling capital of Central China’s Hubei province, is a commercial center divided by the Yangtze and Han rivers. The city contains many lakes and parks, 
    including expansive, picturesque East Lake. Nearby, the Hubei Provincial Museum displays relics from the Warring States period, including the Marquis Yi of Zeng’s coff
    in and bronze musical bells from his 5th-century B.C. tomb.</p>
